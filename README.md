# Capstone Project - NAPLAN Analysis for a Public High School

## NAPLAN

NAPLAN: National Assessment Program â€“ Literacy and Numeracy

It is a national test for Australia Students in Year 3, 5, 7 and 9.

The NAPLAN tests would be used to determine if students were performing either above, at or below the National Minimum Standard.

The common assessment scale has ten bands.

Band 1 is the lowest band and band 10 is the highest band.


From 2017, year 9 students  need to get a mark of Band 8 or above in their NAPLAN tests to be guaranteed of qualifying for their HSC.

Students who don't meet the minimum standard in their year 9 NAPLAN will have to sit extra test to reach HSC.

## Customer

My clinet for this project is a public high school in NSW.

The school would like to know which question they need to spend some additional time on to improve the Y9 Naplan score. and they want to identify thoes students at risk of not meeting the minimum standard, which is Band 8 in y9 naplan test. 

For this project, I will focus on the numercy part only.

## What is the customer requirements?

1. Analysis the data to see if there is any particular question type that we need spend some additional time on.

2. A way to predict which students won't meet the minimum standard.

3. A way to predict what different students might need addition help with.

I will focus on the numercy part only.


## Pre-processing


Datas (Y2012 - Y2017): 

1. Y7: score for each questions and Band

2. Y9: score for each questions and Band

3. Questions: Syllabus code, question number and Description

To get features:

1. score for each question
2. Verbs for each question

## EDA

1. Show the performance for this school from 2012 tp 2017.
2. Use Y9 questions to find out which questions school need to put more effort on.

## Prediction

Use student previous performance to predict their y9 score
